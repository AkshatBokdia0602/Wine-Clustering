## Prerequisites 🛠️
Before running the code in this project, make sure you have the following libraries and tools installed:
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

## Dataset 🗂️

We use a wine dataset for this project. The dataset contains various attributes related to different wines, such as chemical composition and quality ratings. These attributes are used to identify natural groupings of wines based on their similarities.

## Project Overview 📋
The project can be summarized in the following steps:
1. Importing necessary libraries.
2. Importing the wine dataset.
3. Summarizing the dataset by examining its shape and displaying a preview of the data.
4. Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing the data using the StandardScaler
5. Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
6. K-Means clustering algorithm to partition the data into clusters based on the PCA-transformed features.
7. Agglomerative clustering on the PCA-transformed data to create hierarchical clusters.
8. Affinity Propagation clustering on the PCA-transformed data to automatically identify cluster centers.
9. Kernel PCA to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
10. K-Means, Agglomerative, and Affinity Propagation clustering on the kernel PCA-transformed data.

## Conclusion 🏁

This project showcases the application of various clustering techniques to segment wines into meaningful groups based on their attributes. By utilizing dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms, we gain insights into the underlying structure of the wine dataset, which can be valuable for further analysis and decision-making in the wine industry.
